Reassess North and South territories â€” consider leadership, resources, or market size reviews.

Invest more in East and West to capitalize on momentum.

Diversify offerings around top products (e.g., flavored coffees).

Phase out or rebrand underperforming products like Beer unless niche demand justifies continued sales.

4. Customer Management
Implement CRM tools to retain and grow top-tier customers.

Launch loyalty or referral programs to encourage repeat business.

5. Marketing & Promotion
Promote bulk purchases to increase average sale value.

Use peak months (e.g., December) as reference for future campaign planning.
